# Crude-Oil-Price-Prediction
-	Objective: To forecast crude oil prices through advanced predictive modeling for the next 90 days.
-	Tools used: Python, Jupiter Notebook, Pandas, Prophet Library, Matplotlib, streamlit for deployment 
-	Employed web scraping techniques to gather historical data from relevant websites.
-	Implemented various ML models including regression, ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet.
-	Dealt with the inherent volatility of crude oil prices, making prediction challenging and finally deployed the model for forecasting.
